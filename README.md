# Deep Neural Networks for Object Enumeration - IEEE Big Data 2018  
Estimating object count from images is a difficult problem that has a wide range of applications. In this work, we examine the object counting problem for images from the Amazon Bin Images Dataset. This task is riddled with many challenges, including occasional low image quality, object occlusions, and diversity in objects. This work explores a deep- learning approach using a CNN architecture for this object counting problem. Our solution combines end-to-end training on ResNet with test time augmentation, achieving promising results for this difficult task.  

Keywords - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); Amazon Bin Images Dataset; ResNet; Object Counting
